What jobs are most crucial?
--------------------------------------
- Adding ASTList as a leaf of AbstractSyntaxTree
- Adding the functions under README's functions.
	- We have the booleans now but we still need to add in most of the predefined functions 
- After these two we have user defined functions 
	
	
Which components constitute core functionality (vs non essential)? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Both ASTList and the predefined functions consitute core functionality. 
- Without ASTList, we will not be able to code some of the predefined functions 
- And we need the predefined functions because they are a main part of what the user uses 
- We are also allowing user defined functions
- Non essential is a sandbox mode where the user can input expressions that gets evaluated
	- But this is absolutely last after everything else

Which components are prerequisites for others? 
------------------------------------------------
- ASTList is a prerequisite for some of the prerequisite methods are stated above
- And the predefined functions will allow for user defined functions

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ASTList can be done by one person
- The predefined functions will be split among the three of us 
	- Debugging may require a group effort 

	
Timeline: 
- ASTList to be done in class or as soon as possible
- The predefined functions should be mostly done by the end of Wednesday or the start of Thursday
- User defined function functionality must be finished by the end of Thursday
